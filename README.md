# Overview
A repository dedicated to study about developing stages to deliver a product of software. In general, it is practicing Software Engineering <br>

# Stages of developing a product of software
1. Think of an idea, deliverables, finish the diagrams for the system (Non-technical aspect)
2. Set up Version Control (e.g. Git, Github)
3. Determine the tech stack, utilize build modules like CMake for C++
4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Development
5. Deploy
<br><br>
## 1.Version Control
Version Control is a crucial component in software engineering. It is a system helps capture the details of input and changes made to the product, which will then be delivered. <br>

The two most common tools of Version Control is Git and Github. While Git is more on local version control, Github is a centralized website to commit our code into online repositories.<br>

This section would also include some setups and commands that are useful for future implementation.<br>
